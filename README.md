# Data Streaming with Kafka

This project aims to build a Kafka data engineering solution for processing real-time telecommunications mobile money data. The project involves setting up a Kafka cluster, developing a Kafka producer, developing a Kafka consumer, processing the data, and testing the solution using a provided dummy JSON file.

## Project Steps

1. **Set up a Kafka cluster:** Configure and deploy a Kafka cluster capable of handling high volumes of data. The cluster can be hosted either in the cloud or on-premises.

2. **Develop a Kafka producer:** Create a Kafka producer that can efficiently ingest data from telecommunications mobile money transactions and send it to the Kafka cluster. Ensure the producer is designed to handle high volumes of data.

3. **Develop a Kafka consumer:** Implement a Kafka consumer to receive data from the Kafka cluster and process it efficiently. The consumer should be capable of handling high volumes of data and be optimized for efficient processing.

4. **Process the data:** Once the Kafka pipeline is set up, process the data for analysis. This may involve tasks such as data cleaning, aggregation, performing calculations, and generating visualizations.


## Dummy JSON Data

The provided dummy JSON file represents mobile money data and can be used for testing the solution. Example data structure:

```
{
  "transaction_id": "12345",
  "sender_phone_number": "256777123456",
  "receiver_phone_number": "256772987654",
  "transaction_amount": 100000,
  "transaction_time": "2023-04-19 12:00:00"
}
```

Please note that the actual implementation and code specifics may vary based on your requirements and the Kafka configuration being used.
